# Privacy Policy

_Last updated: July 28, 2025_

Rhystic Buddy ("the App") is an open-source life and counter tracking application for Magic: The Gathering™ Commander games. We take your privacy seriously. This policy explains what data the App collects, how it is used, and your choices.

## 1. Information We Collect

### 1.1 Personal Information

The App does **not** collect, transmit, or store any personally identifiable information (PII).

### 1.2 Gameplay & Settings Data

All life totals, counters, background images, and other settings you enter are stored **only on your device** using React-Native AsyncStorage. This data never leaves your device unless you explicitly back it up or share it.

### 1.3 Network Requests

The App performs read-only requests to the public [Scryfall](https://scryfall.com/docs/api) API in order to display card images and ruling text. No personal information is included in these requests. Scryfall’s servers may log standard HTTP metadata such as your IP address—please refer to Scryfall’s own privacy policy for details.

## 2. How We Use Information

Because the App does not collect personal data, we do not process, share, sell, or otherwise use your information for advertising or analytics purposes.

## 3. Data Storage & Security

All user-generated data is stored locally on your device. Removing the App from your device will delete this data. We rely on industry-standard security practices provided by the underlying operating system; however, we cannot guarantee absolute security.

## 4. Third-Party Services

The App interacts only with:

- **Scryfall API** – to retrieve publicly available card information.

No other third-party SDKs, analytics, or advertising libraries are included.

## 5. Children’s Privacy

The App is intended for general audiences and does not knowingly collect information from children under 13. Because no personal data is collected, the App complies with COPPA by design.

## 6. Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Updates will be posted in this repository and the effective date will be revised. Continued use of the App after changes constitutes acceptance of the new terms.

## 7. Contact Us

If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please open an issue in the GitHub repository or contact us at `rhysticbuddyapp@gmail.com`.
